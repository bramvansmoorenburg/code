##  15 digits
several functions which can format numbers into 'super numbers', which are numbers that can have more than 15 digits, the maximum allowed by R. these functions can also add, subtract and multiply these numbers. supernumbers are formatted in several chunks of 15 numbers. the first chunk is not part of the number, but indicates the location of the comma in the number. so a first chunk value of 20 means that the comma is located after the 20th digit, or digit 5 of chunk 2 of the actual number.
